<h3>ACTING CAREEER</h3>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger_filmography#:~:text=He%20began%20his%20acting%20career,in%20action%20and%20comedy%20films." target="_main"><img src="https://c8.alamy.com/comp/2KX6606/the-terminator-arnold-schwarzenegger-2KX6606.jpg" alt="action star" height="400"></a>
<P>Schwarzenegger wanted to move from bodybuilding into acting, finally achieving it when he was chosen to play the title role in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercules_in_New_York"> Hercules in New York</a> (1970).
     Credited under the stage name "Arnold Strong", his accent in the film was so thick that his lines were dubbed after production.
      His second film appearance was as a mob hitman in The Long Goodbye (1973), which was followed by a much more significant part in the film Stay Hungry (1976), for which he won the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actor. 
      Schwarzenegger has discussed his early struggles in developing his acting career: "It was very difficult for me in the beginning – I was told by agents and casting people that my body was 'too weird', that I had a funny accent, and that my name was too long.
       You name it, and they told me I had to change it. Basically, everywhere I turned, I was told that I had no chance."</P>
          
       <p>Schwarzenegger's breakthrough film was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_and_sorcery">sword and sorcery</a>epic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conan_the_Barbarian_(1982_film)">Conan the Barbarian</a>
        in 1982, which was a box-office hit. Schwarzenegger's roles reflected his sense of humor, separating him from more serious action hero films.
         He made a number of successful action films in the 1980s, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commando_(1985_film)"> Commando</a> (1985),<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_Deal_(1986_film)">Raw Deal</a>  (1986),<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Running_Man_(1987_film)">The Running Man </a> (1987), 
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predator_(film)">Predator</a>  (1987), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Heat_(1988_film)">Red Heat</a>  (1988).

    </p>

   <p> In 1984, he made his first appearance as the eponymous character in James Cameron's science fiction action film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terminator">The Terminator</a>. In 2003,
     he made his third appearance as the title character in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_3:_Rise_of_the_Machines">Terminator</a>  3: Rise of the Machines, which went on to earn over $150 million domestically (equivalent to $239 million today).
